## Introduction

The "Letter Strike" program is an arcade-style game that challenges players to test their typing skills while having fun. Your mission is to strike down falling letters by pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard. The game features multiple levels, increasing difficulty, and the goal of achieving the highest score. 

"Letter Strike" is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, incorporating the sprite system provided by the Pygame library.

## Setup

You only need the appropriate version of python and its libraries,  running in your IDLE environment (I recommend Visual studio code or PyCharm)
